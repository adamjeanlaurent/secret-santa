Need a way so that users can type as many names as they want and then assign each person another random one

Needs to be an even amount of people

we can read repeatedly if a loop, having the user type some sort of string to stop input

collect all users with an id(number) as the key of a dictionary with the value as their name, then walk through and assign each another
random person using a set to keep track of who is done

dictionary[id -> name]
use set to assign random value
    int r = rand(between 1 and numOfPeople);
how to store pairs ?
use an array of pair objects

then print out of the pairs
